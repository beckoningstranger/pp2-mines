                    MineSweeper is a logic game that also involves some guesswork. 
                    The aim of the game is to uncover the whole playing field without stepping onto a mine. 
                    Differently put, you need to click all squares that do not have a mine.

                    <div class="explanation-with-picture">
                        First, note that once you have started a game, you can click the circle arrow to restart. 
                        After clicking it, the computer creates a new playing field. 
                        No two games of MineSweeper are the same! 
                        As its unavoidable to step on mines, you will have to restart quite often. 
                        Don't be discouraged, this is a natural part of the game. 
                        The off button allows you to navigate back to the start menu.

                <div>
                    At the beginning of the game, you have absolutely no information about where mines are 
                    and will need to click any squares to gain more information. 
                    A good strategy is to click the corner and border squares, as they only have 3 or 5 adjacent squares respectively. 
                    This does not reduce your chance to step on a mine, but often the information you get will lead to more progress.
                </div>

                <div class="explanations-image-left">
                    <div class="image-left"><img src="assets/images/step1.png" alt="A picture where the player has uncovered the top left square, finding a zero."></div>
                    <div class="explanation-with-picture">
                        Once you click a square, you know how many mines there are in the adjacent squares. 
                        Whenever you find one with no adjacent mines i. e. a "zero square", you can uncover all surrounding squares. 
                        Here, we have such a situation. The player can now uncover all surrounding squares.
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div class="explanations-image-right">
                    <div class="image-right"><img src="assets/images/step2.png" alt="A picture where the player has uncovered a number of squares, getting good information."></div>
                    <div class="explanation-with-picture">
                        After finding more zeroes and clicking all surrounding square to them we have reached this position. Look at the "three square" now.
                        It has three mines in surrounding squares and there are only three squares that have not been uncovered yet next to it. 
                        Ergo the mines must be in these three squares. It is a good idea to mark mine squares by right-clicking them.
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div>
                    Note that the 'Mines' counter will go down every time you mark a mine, so you always know how many mines are left for you to find.
                </div>
                <div>
                    When you look at the two squares above and below the three squares, you will see that they border on two mines. 
                    Well, we already know where these mines are as we just marked them. 
                    This means, that we can safely click the remaining surrounding squares.
                </div>

                <div class="explanations-image-left">
                    <div class="image-left"><img src="assets/images/step3.png" alt="A picture where the player has marked mines and can now continue to uncover more squares."></div>
                    <div class="explanation-with-picture">
                        After doing that, we have found two "one squares". 
                        Again, we already know where these mines are and can continue to uncover more squares.
                    </div>
                </div>

                <div class="explanations-image-right">
                    <div class="image-right"><img src="assets/images/step4.png" alt="A picture where the player has uncovered more squares, leading to yet more progress."></div>
                    <div class="explanation-with-picture">
                        Unfortunately the information we gained from this does not directly tell us what squares we should mark or click next. 
                        At this point, you will need to guess again. This is just the nature of MineSweeper.

                    Now it's time for you to go mine hunting yourself! Good luck solving these puzzles. Enjoy!
