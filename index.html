            MineSweeper is a logic game that also involves some guesswork. The
            aim of the game is to uncover the whole playing field without
            stepping onto a mine. Differently put, you need to click all squares
            that do not have a mine.
          </div>

                src="assets/images/buttons.webp"
                alt="A picture pointing out the Restart and Quit buttons"
              />
            </div>
            <div class="explanation-with-picture">
              First, note that once you have started a game, you can click the
              circle arrow to restart. After clicking it, the computer creates a
              new playing field. No two games of MineSweeper are the same! As
              its unavoidable to step on mines, you will have to restart quite
              often. Don't be discouraged, this is a natural part of the game.
              The off button allows you to navigate back to the start menu.
            </div>
          </div>
          <div>
            At the beginning of the game, you have absolutely no information
            about where mines are and will need to click a random square to gain
            some information. It is a good strategy to click the corner and
            border squares, as they only have 3 or 5 adjacent squares
            respectively. This does not reduce your chance to step on a mine,
            but often the information you get will lead to more progress.

              <img
                src="assets/images/step1.webp"
                alt="A picture where the player has uncovered the top left square, finding a zero."
              />
            </div>
            <div class="explanation-with-picture">
              Once you click a square, you know how many mines there are in the
              adjacent squares. So whenever you find one with no adjacent mines
              i. e. a "zero square", you can uncover all surrounding squares.
              Here, we have such a situation.
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class="explanations-image-right">
            <div class="image-right">

                src="assets/images/step2.webp"
                alt="A picture where the player has uncovered a number of squares, getting good information."
              />
            </div>
            <div class="explanation-with-picture">
              After finding more zeroes and clicking all their surrounding
              squares we have reached this position. Look at the "three square"
              now. It has three mines in surrounding squares and there are only
              three squares that have not been uncovered yet next to it. Ergo
              the mines must be in these three squares. It is a good idea to
              mark mine squares by right-clicking or them. If you're on a mobile
              device, tap and hold for a short while.
            </div>
          </div>
          <div>
            Note that the mines counter at the top will go down every time you
            mark a mine, so you always know how many mines there are left for
            you to find.
          </div>
          <div>
            When you look at the "two squares" above and below the "three
            square", you will see that they border on two mines. Well, we
            already know where these mines are as we just marked them. This
            means that we can safely click the remaining surrounding squares.
          </div>
          <div class="explanations-image-left">
            <div class="image-left">
              <img
                src="assets/images/step3.webp"
                alt="A picture where the player has marked mines and can now continue to uncover more squares."
              />
            </div>
            <div class="explanation-with-picture">
              After doing that, we have found two "one squares". Again, we
              already know where these mines are and can continue to uncover
              more squares.
            </div>

              />
            </div>
            <div class="explanation-with-picture">
              Unfortunately the information we gained from this does not
              directly tell us what squares we should mark or click next. At
              this point, you will need to guess again. This is just the nature
              of MineSweeper.
