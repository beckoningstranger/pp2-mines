# Validator Testing

## HTML and CSS

To test compliance with HTML standards, the [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/) was used. Here are the results for all files:

## Javascript

To ensure that there are no problems in my Javascript code I used JSHint and discussed the results with my mentor.

# Responsiveness Test

Extensive tests were conducted to ensure that the website looks great both on devices as small as the Galaxy Fold, which has only 280px of horizontal space when in portrait mode, up to viewports with 1920px in viewport width such as desktop computers. Mobile devices were tested with both Google Chrome and Firefox Dev Tools and both in portrait as well as landscape mode.

All tests were carried out in the developer tools of the browsers.
